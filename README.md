## Useful Info
> This website is built using
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). Pages & components are written in TypeScript, the styles in vanilla CSS with
variables using
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
(We would have preferred using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) but docusaurus has no ssr support for
it yet)

## Local Hosting
Honestly it's a pain in the ass but if you know your way around
Typescript it shouldn't serve as much of a challenge to you ❤️
